Below are build instructions for Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 13.10.

These instructions assume that you install in the default location, which is
~/foam/ . Create this folder with:

    cd ~
    mkdir foam


* Obtain and unpack source code (if you read this, you probably already have):

The recommended way is to get the source code through git source code
management system. This way, you can get updates and bugfixes easily by running
"git pull". To install into the default location run:

    cd ~/foam
    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openfoam-extend/foam-extend-3.1


Alternatively, you can download a snapshot (.tgz) of the source code from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/openfoam-extend/files/foam-extend-3.1/


* Install required packages:

    sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential flex bison \
    zlib1g-dev qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev libncurses5-dev libxt-dev rpm \
    mercurial graphviz

* Set environment variables:

    cd ~/foam/foam-extend-3.1
    . etc/bashrc

Optionally, set environment variable for Qt to compile ParaView:

    export QT_BIN_DIR=/usr/bin

Optionally, set environment variable for compiling Cuda solvers, for example
(replace "sm_30" with value according to your GPU architecture):

    export CUDA_ARCH=sm_30


* Compile:

    ./Allwmake.firstInstall


* Create user directory:

    mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN


And you are ready to start.
