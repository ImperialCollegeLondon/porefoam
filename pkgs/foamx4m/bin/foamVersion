Usage: $Script [-revision] [-help]

 Report on the version of OpenFOAM, and if available, the source code revision number.

 If the source code revision number is not directly available, then the string
 "exported" will be reported for the revision number.

 Options:
     -revision : Report only the revision number
     -help     : this help

USAGE
    exit 1
}


# Initialize the SVN client command
SVN_CMD='svn'

# initialize the Revision number to "exported" by default.
# This is the expected information reported by svnversion when the source code is not from a
# svn working copy
FOAM_DEV_SVN_REVISION_NUMBER="exported"

if [ -e $WM_PROJECT_DIR/.svn ]
then
  # Check if a svn client in available
  status=`$SVN_CMD --version --quiet >& /dev/null`

  if [ "$?" -eq 0 ]
  then
     # We are not using svnversion here because it is recursive, and this can take a while.
     #
     # We are forcing LC_ALL=C in order to get rid of any locale variations in the ouput of
     # the command $SVN_CMD
     #
     # We are grabbing the revision number associated to "Last Changed Rev:" for the svn repository
     # branch associated with $WM_PROJECT_DIR. That way, we will not pickup changes in revision number
     # coming from other parts of the Subversion repository.
     #
     FOAM_DEV_SVN_REVISION_NUMBER=`LC_ALL=C $SVN_CMD info $WM_PROJECT_DIR | grep "Last Changed Rev:" | awk '{print $4}'`;
