Contents:

surfaceAdd
- adds to surface files. (but does not intersect or anything)

surfaceBooleanOp
- Boolean operations (add, or, xor) on closed surfaces. Probably not working.

surfaceCheck
- checks surface for incorrect topology. Checks normals of neighbouring faces.

surfaceCoarsen
- Stan Melax coarsening algorithm

surfaceConvert
- Converts surfaces to/from various formats

surfaceFind
- Finds nearest vertex and face to given point.

surfaceMeshTriangulate
- Triangulate external facses of mesh and write as surface.

surfacePointMerge
- Explicit point merge of surface.

surfaceSetOutside
- Orient normals on (closed) surface.

surfaceSmooth
- Laplacian smoothing on surface vertices

surfaceSubset
- Subsets surface

surfaceToPatch
- Applies region information of surfaces to mesh.
  Each external face of mesh gets region number of nearest surface triangle.

surfaceMeshConvert
- Similar to surfaceConvert, but uses surfMesh library
