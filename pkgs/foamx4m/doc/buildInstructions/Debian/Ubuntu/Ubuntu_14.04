Below are build instructions for Ubuntu 14.04.

These instructions assume that you install in the default location, which is
~/foam/ . Create this folder with:

    cd ~
    mkdir foam


* Obtain and unpack source code (if you read this, you probably already have):

The recommended way is to get the source code through git source code
management system. This way, you can get updates and bugfixes easily by running
"git pull". To install into the default location run:

    cd ~/foam
    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openfoam-extend/foam-extend-3.1


Alternatively, you can download a snapshot (.tgz) of the source code from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/openfoam-extend/files/foam-extend-3.1/


* Update your Ubuntu installation:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

* Install required packages:

    sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential flex \
    zlib1g-dev qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev libncurses5-dev libiberty-dev \
    libxt-dev rpm mercurial graphviz openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev cmake


* For Ubuntu 14.04, you need to customize some of the ThirdParty packages
  in order to enable the usage of system-provided packages, and to enable
  the compilation of other, like bison-2.7.

  Here is a list of sed commands that will do just that. You can copy/paste
  the following block of commands in a control terminal in order to make
  the necessary adjustments. You will need to be located at the root of your
  foam-extend-3.1 installation for those commands to work.

* Set environment variables:

    cd ~/foam/foam-extend-3.1
    . etc/bashrc

Optionally, set environment variable for compiling Cuda solvers, for example
(replace "sm_30" with value according to your GPU architecture):

    export CUDA_ARCH=sm_30


* Compile:

    ./Allwmake.firstInstall


* Create user directory:

    mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN


And you are ready to start.
