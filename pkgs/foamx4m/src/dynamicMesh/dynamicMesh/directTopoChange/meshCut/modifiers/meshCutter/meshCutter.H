Class
	Foam::meshCutter

Description
	Cuts (splits) cells.

	Description of cut is given as a loop of 'cuts' per cell (see cellCuts).
	setRefinement() takes this cut description and inserts the nessecary
	topoActions (add points/faces/cells) into the directTopoChange.

	Stores added cells/faces/points.

	Cut description gives orientation to cut by calculating 'anchorPoints'.
	The side of the cell that contains the anchorPoints is the master cell.
	Likewise the cells' edges will have the split added as a duplicate of the
	master (anchor) point.
	Think of it as the cell with the anchor points at the bottom. Add a face
	at the bottom to split the cell and then sweep this face up to be through
	the middle of the cell (inflation).


	-# Start:
	   cell with anchor points at bottom
	@verbatim
	+-------+
	|	   +
	|	   +
	|	   +
	|	   +
	|	   +
	|	   +
	|	   +
	+-------+
	anchor  anchor
	@endverbatim


	-# Topo change:
	   splitface introduced at bottom of cell, introducing a new
	   cell and splitting the side faces into two.
	@verbatim
	+-------+
	|	   +
	|	   +
	|	   + <- addedCell
	|	   +
	|	   +
	|	   +
	+-------+ <- splitFace
	+-------+ <- original cell
	anchor  anchor
	@endverbatim


	-# Inflation:
	   splitface shifted up to middle of cell (or wherever cut was)
	@verbatim
	+-------+
	|	   +
	|	   + <- addedCell
	|	   +
	+-------+ <- splitFace
	|	   +
	|	   + <- original cell
	|	   +
	+-------+
	anchor  anchor
	@endverbatim

	Anyway this was the original idea. Inflation was meant to handle
	conservative properties distribution without interpolation.
	(just face sweeping through space). But problem was that
	only if the introduced splitface was exactly the same shape as bottom face
	(so same 2D topo or perfectly flat) the volume between them was 0.

	This meshCutting still uses anchorPoints though:
	- the master cell is the one without the anchor points. The added cell
	  (on top of the splitFace) is the with.
	- the splitFace is owned by the master cell (since it has the lower number)
	- the side faces get split and get either the original cell as neighbour
	  or the added cell (if the faces contain the cell anchor points)
