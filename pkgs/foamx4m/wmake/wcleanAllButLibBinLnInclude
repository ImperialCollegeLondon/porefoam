# Script
#     wcleanAllButLibBinLnInclude
#
# Description
#     search all the directories below the current for the object file
#     directories of all machines and *.dep files, and delete them.
#     This scripts is the same as wcleanAll, except that it leaves
#     the lib, applications/bin, and lnInclude directories untouched.
#     The purpose is to minimize an installation, while keeping it fully
#     operational and keeping the possibility to compile user code.
