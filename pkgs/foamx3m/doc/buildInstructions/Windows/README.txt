1. INTRODUCTION
===============

It is strongly recommended to install all required systems tools and utilities
in a directory with no embedded white spaces. You can skip some steps if you
already have the correct tools installed on your system.


2. INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING ON WINDOWS
=======================================

1) Download and install 7-Zip (see reference list below). This is necessary to
   be able to unzip the rest of the required packages mentioned in later steps.

2) Download and install wget, CMake, Git, MinGW-w64, ParaView, PExports, Java,
   Subversion, Python (see reference list below). Note that some components
   (for example PExports and GMake) may already be available in other packages
   (such as Strawberry Perl), although you need to be careful of the
    version numbers.

3) Download and install MSYS (see reference list below). If this is your first
   use of MSYS, create a file fstab in c/MinGW/msys/1.0/etc with single-line contents:
       c:/mingw /mingw
   This mounts your home directory (this assumes you have installed MSYS to the default
   c:/MinGW directory). From Windows, you will find your home directory under
       c:/MinGW/msys/1.0/home/<user name>

4) Download the foam-extend 4.0 source code using Git:
       git clone -b nextRelease http://git.code.sf.net/p/foam-extend/foam-extend-3.2 foam-extend-4.0

5) Open a new MSYS shell and chdir to your foam-extend-4.0 source directory.

6) Edit the user-modifiable entries in etc/bashrc.mingw to point to the
   locations where you have installed the required system tools in the first two
   steps (the first two functions only in bashrc.mingw). The order in which they
   are added to the PATH (in the add_to_path function) is very important. The
   PATH is read from left to right, so ensure OpenMPI and MinGW compiler are
   prepended last to the PATH, so they are found first.

7) Source the file edited in the previous step using the command:
       . etc/bashrc.mingw
   (notice the dot "." command to source a file). This action sources other
   files as required, and also performs a check on the versions of the installed
   system tools.  An example output is shown at the end of this file.

8) If "mpirun.exe" failed to run due to a missing DLL (eg. msvcr100.dll), you
   may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (see
   reference list below).

9) If the version checks were all successful and printed the expected version
   details, proceed with compiling the code. Run "Allwmake.mingw". This will
   download and build all required third-party dependencies, build the entire
   foam-extend code, and also create a stand-alone .zip package.

10) After the build has completed, you can run foam in either of two ways:

   (a). From the MSYS shell. This allows use of the utility programs and shell
        scripts in the bin directory (such as paraFoam). This is the recommended
        approach for developers.

   (b). From a standard Windows CMD.exe command prompt using the created
        foam-extend-4.0-win-x64.{7z,zip} stand-alone package. This can be used on any
        Windows machine without access to MSYS shells or compilers. See the
        READMEBinaryPackage.txt contained within the package for further details.
